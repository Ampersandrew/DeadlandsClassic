Copyright free SVG and print ready playing cards - by Adrian Kennard (RevKÂ®)

For hundreds of years people have been [badly] copying playing cards (see this
article*: for more details) and I am proud to be part of that long standing
tradition and offer my SVG playing card sets, well, a lot of them in fact, to
the public domain. The court cards are based on 19th Century Goodall & Son
designs. There are loads of options, but some examples have been picked out to
get you started.
